There is increasingly widespread recognition of the fact that health outcomes are often profoundly shaped by social factors, and that disparate access and uneven distributions of social, economic, and environmental resources lead to inequities in community and population health status and risk.  

This Shiny application explores the social determinants of health in New York state and their spatial manifestation by integrating and visualizing data on social, economic, housing, and other population characteristics from the United States Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS) and Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) scores for the same year obtained from the NYS Department of Health's Health Data NY portal.     

The Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services, that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify quality of care for "ambulatory care sensitive conditions." These are conditions for which good outpatient care can potentially prevent the need for hospitalization or for which early intervention can prevent complications or more severe disease.  While PQIs are based upon hospital inpatient data, they provide insight into the quality and accessibility of the community health care system and other services available outside the hospital setting.
